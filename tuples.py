we can do l[0]=10 and l[1]=20 but
we cannot do tuple[0]=10 and tuple[1]=20 because tuples does not support changing
the diff. in a tuple and a list is just of brackets
in tuples we use ()
and in list we use []
"""
# to make a tuple of size one we should have to put a comma',' after the first element other it will be an int or float
tuple1 = (1,)  # tuple of size/length 1
# to check whether it is in tuple or not
if 2 in tuple:
    print("yes")
tup2 = tuple[1:5]  # slicing of tuple give a new tuple
